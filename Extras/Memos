Notes taken from Practical Reinforcement Learning course

Week 3 - On-Policy vs Off-Policy
On Policy
  Agent can pick actions
  Most Obvious
  Agent always follows his own policy
  Can't learn off-policy
  faster/better

Off Policy
  Agent can't pick actions
  Learns with exploration, plays without
  Learning from expert (expert is imperfect)
  Learning from sessions (recorded data)
  Can learn on-policy
  learns optimal policy even if agent takes random actions
  
*Review types of DQN


Regret
  dif between real optimal vs agent gotten 'reward' when applied
  Less regret = better exploration
